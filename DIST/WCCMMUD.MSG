 Enter the activation code which Metropolis gave you when
 you purchased this package.

 If you have not done so yet, PLEASE read the sysop
 release notes to find out HOW TO APPLY a database
 update.  This is EXTREMELY important because if there
 are database updates which you have not applied then
 your game will not function properly.

ACTIVATE {DEMO} S 30 Enter your activation code

 This is the number of normal credits which will be 
 consumed while in the game.  Exempt users are not 
 charged this amount.  Note that this is NOT a surcharge.
 This replaces your basic board billing.  The minimum 
 value for this follows general bbs minimum rules (ie.
 if it is less than 4, I believe that 0 credits will be
 charged)

GAMCRD {Credits per minute consumed while in the game 0} N 0 32767

 This is the number of credits which will be charged to all
 users in addition to the normal amounts.  Note that even 
 exempt users will be charged this amount.  Note also that 
 this amount will not be charged until the user has spent 
 FREEMIN minutes in the game.  If not 0, this must be at 
 least 2 - a value of 1 will charge 0 credits.

REALCRD {Credits consumed per minute by ALL users (even Exempt) 0} N 0 32767

 This sets the number of minutes a user may be in the game
 per day before the REALCRD credits start getting charged.

FREEMIN {Minutes of free time for exempt users 2} N 0 1440

 Owners of this key may execute all of the sysop functions
 in MajorMUD.

SYSOPKEY {SYSOP} S 15 Key Required to issue SYSOP commands

 Owners of this key may only execute a subset of the
 sysop functions in MajorMUD.  (The exact commands
 available are documented in the sysop release notes.)

GAMOPKEY {WCCGAMEOP} S 15 Key Required to issue GAMEOP commands

 Loans must ALWAYS be guaranteed with real credits 
 (i.e. EXEMPT users must still have credits), but you may 
 restrict access even further with this key.

 NOTE THAT THIS OPTION IS CURRENTLY DISABLED IN THE GAME!

LOANKEY {SYSOP} S 15 Key Required to get loans from the banks

 Pretty Self-Explanatory.  This key is required for
 a user to enter and play MajorMUD.

PLAYKEY {DEMO} S 15 Key Required to play the game

 If the user has this key, then they may not play the game
 with one exeption: If they also have the SYSOPKEY, then
 they may still play.  Do NOT leave this option blank.

NOPLAYKY {NOMUD} S 15 Key used to ban a user from the game

 Only players with this key will have their MMUD characters 
 saved.  This should be the same as the PLAYKEY on most 
 systems, but can be used to provide demo access to play
 the game if desired. (i.e. Give paying users both the
 PLAYKEY and the SAVEKEY, but give guests only the PLAYKEY.
 Do NOT leave this option blank.

SAVEKEY {normal} S 15 Key required to save a player's character

 To progress beyond the level as you have specified in 
 DEMOLVL, the user must have this key.  If they do not 
 have this key, they may continue playing, but they
 will not be able to train.

NODMOKEY {normal} S 15 Key required to pass level DEMOLVL

 If you have paying classes for which you don't mind if they
 run out of credits while playing MajorMUD, you can give
 them this key.  If a user with this key runs out of credits
 while playing MajorMUD, they will not be kicked out of the
 game.  If they do not have this key and run out of credits
 they will be automatically kicked out of the game.

NOKICKEY {nokickme} S 15 Key required to avoid low credit exits

 If a user has this key then they will not be able to use
 the gossip channel.  (SYSOPKEY and GAMEOPKEY holders are
 exempted from this)

 If a user has the NOPAYKEY they will not be charged credits
 while in MajorMUD.

NOPAYKEY {nopaykey} S 15 Key to avoid credit charges in MajorMUD




LEVEL4 {}

 The game will automatically save BUFTOSAV active players 
 at this interval.  It is usually a good idea to keep this 
 relatively low so that the players characters will be 
 saved at a decent rate, but if you have a slow hard disk,
 increase this parameter and let the users suffer if the
 system crashes.

SECOTH {Seconds between saving Player data? 30} N 1 20000

 This specifies the frequency at which the game checks to 
 save any modified data.  If this time is too large then 
 the chance of data loss due to a system crash (power 
 failure, etc.) increases.

SECBUFF {Seconds between saving Buffer data? 60} N 1 20000

 To reduce a burst of overhead, only a specific number of 
 users will be saved on each cycle.  If you have hardware
 disk caching, then this parameter can be increased.  On 
 the other hand, if you have a slower hard disk, then you 
 might want to reduce this parameter.  In other words,
 leave this at 1 (one) unless you have a VERY GOOD hard 
 disk cache.

BUFTOSAV {Number of buffers to save/set? 10} N 1 32767

 In addition to 2034 bytes per user channel, the game uses
 a set of in-memory buffers to improve performance.  The 
 help on each of the following parameters will help you 
 determine the appropriate value for your system.
 If you set the values too high, you will get a PLTILE 
 catastro error upon system startup.  In this case, you 
 must decrease the values until your system starts 
 correctly. Each room buffered in memory will take up at 
 LEAST 1498 bytes.  Default: 2000
 Minimum Recommended: 10 times number of users playing

ROOMBUF {Number of rooms to buffer in memory? 25000} N 10 32767

 When the user's profile is set to SLOW talking, they must 
 precede each line with this character if they want it 
 treated as speaking.

TALKCHAR {Character to start lines for talking (slow): .} C

 This character starts off any line which the

 The user will not die until their HP reach this point. 
 Between 0 hp and this number, they will be 'unconscious'.

DEATHHP {Number of hit points at which the user dies? -100} N -20000 0

 This determines how many levels of experience the user is 
 allowed to attain before training.  Any further experience
 earned will not be added to the user's experience.

XTRALVL {Extra Levels of Experience before Training? 10} N 0 16

What level of punishment do you want to give your users
if they drop carrier while in the game?

  HIGH   = Always punish
  MEDIUM = Only punish if attacking/being attacked
  LOW    = Only punish if in PVP combat (attacking
           or being attacked)
  NONE   = Never punish 

PUNHUP {Level of punishment for hanging up? NONE} E HIGH MEDIUM LOW NONE

 This option will limit the number of users or gangs which
 the user may request in the TOP n and TOP n GANGS commands.

MAXTOP {Maximum number of TOPTEN users/gangs lists? 100} N 10 3000

 When the user dies their last life or rerolls, their 
 character will keep this percentage of their evil points
 in the next character they create.

EVILKEEP {Percentage of evil points to keep? 50} N 0 100

 MajorMUD will send email such as internal logic errors,
 feedback from users, and unavailable help requests via
 Mailink (If present on the system) to Lance@WCC.  If you
 wish to receive a copy of this mail, specify the user
 account to receive the mail here.

MAILUSER {Sysop} S 29 User to receive internal mail

 This limits the amount of profanity allowed in the
 Game when talking to each other.  It does not affect
 gang broadcasts or telepaths.  

PROFCHEK {Profanity checking? NO} B

 This specifies the rate at which you want MajorMUD to
 perform initialization.  With a lower rate, your board
 will run faster during the initialization period, but
 will take longer to initialize.  If this is less than
 200 then it will be divided by 4 during recovery mode.
 This was put in for a board which was dialing out to
 a voice mail system and needed to be running immediately.
 If you don't need this, set the option to 20000, if
 you do, 80 isn't a bad value but trial and error will tell.

INITRATE {Rate to perform initialization? 5000} N 10 20000

 The polling rate is used as a counter between saving
 game buffers during the polling routine.  The value
 for this number is dependant upon both your number of
 users who are normally in MajorMUD, your normal system 
 loading, and your CPU speed.  If you have a fast cpu, a
 low normal load rate, and a lot of users in MMUD, then 
 raise this number.  If you seem to get a high system 
 loading with a lot of disk access whenever the buffers 
 start saving, then RAISE this parameter.

POLLRATE {Relative polling counter? 2000} N 10 2000

 If you want to allow users to play the game to a certain
 level and then force them to switch to another BBS class, 
 etc. to progress, you can specify the maximum level using 
 this option.  The key required to pass this level is set 
 in the option NODMOKEY.  

DEMOLVL {Maximum level attainable without NODMOKEY? 2} N 1 100

 If you feel that displaying the experience of the players
 in the topten command is too technical or gives too much 
 away, you can disable it with this option.

EXPINTEN {Include experience in topten command? YES} B

 If you want to restrict your higher level players
 from attacking lower level players, you can configure
 the maximum difference between the levels using this
 option.  If a player with more than this many levels
 between themselves and their target attempts an attack
 it will be treated as though they were in a protected
 room.  Set this option to -1 to disable PVP completely.
 Note that FIENDS will not get this restriction
 when they are on the losing side (ie lower level)

LVLDIFF {Maximum level difference for PVP? -1} N -1 100

 If you have hangup penalties enabled, this is the
 minimum percentage of their maximum HP which they will
 lose.

MINHUPHP {Minimum percentage to lose on hangup? 0} N 0 100

 If you have hangup penalties enabled, this is the
 maximum percentage of their maximum HP which they will
 lose.

MAXHUPHP {Maximum percentage to lose on hangup? 0} N 0 100

 If you have hangup penalties enabled, this is the
 maximum number of items which they can lose.

MAXHUPIT {Maximum items to lose on hangup? 0} N 0 100

 If a user does not enter any commands for this many 
 seconds, then they will be hung up upon.  It will 
 be treated as though they exitted normally (not a 
 hangup penalty)

INACTIVE {Number of seconds of inactivity allowed? 5000} N 60 32000

 If you wish to move the location of your databases from
 the default BBS directory, you may specify the location 
 here with either a relative path from the bbs directory
 (ie. "muddats\") or an absolute path (ie. "d:\muddats\").

 Note that this does NOT apply to the update databases.
 If you place those in a directory other than the bbs
 directory, you must enter the full path to them when
 asked for the filename.

 Also, NEVER use a Ram Drive for this location.

DATADIR {} S 37 Location of databases

 If the KEEPEXP option is set to YES, then users will
 keep some of their experience to start a new character
 with after they either die or reroll.  If set to NO
 then they will always start at 0.

KEEPEXP {Keep some experience after final death? YES} B

 If you give out sysop powers in MajorMUD to people
 who are only co-sysops, you may wish to restrict 
 the SYSOP LIGHTNING command so that it only works
 against users who would normally receive lightning.

LIGHTEVY {Allow SYSOP LIGHTNING on all players? YES} B

 If you want to let your users change their gender in
 the game, you may charge them this much gold to 
 do so.  If you set it to -1 then they will not be
 allowed to change gender.  0 will let them do it 
 for free.

GENDERGO {Gold to charge to change gender? -1} N -1 32000

 Enter the amount of accumulated gang experience
 required before a gang leader may purchase a ganghouse.
 This figure is multiplied by a thousand. So a value of
 320 would result in 320,000 experience being required
 to purchase a ganghouse while a value of 31450 would
 result in 31,450,000 experience.

GANGEXP {Experience (x10000) required? 320} N 0 32767

 If you wish to be able to delete a BBS user without
 actually deleting the MajorMUD user then set this
 option to NO. Note that when set to NO, if a BBS user
 is deleted and a new user creates the same account
 name then they will inherit the old MajorMUD character.

DELUSER {Delete MajorMUD user with BBS User? NO} B

 Maximum number of evil points to forgive per day. This
 option is used to control the rate at which your evil
 players return to neutral.  If you set this too high
 then you will increase the chance of corrupt users
 taking advantage and killing everyone in sight.  Too
 low and users may stop playing if they get too evil.
 Refer to the sysop release notes (wccmmud.rln) for
 more information BEFORE CHANGING.

MAXEPDAY {Max EPs to forgive per day? 18} N 4 100

 A portion of the evil points forgiven each day depend
 on the amount of time spent playing MajorMUD without
 performing any evil actions.  This option controls
 the granularity of the required online time.  Refer
 to the sysop release notes (wccmmud.rln) for more
 information BEFORE CHANGING.

EPCYCLE {Minutes per Evil Point Cycle? 60} N 15 360

 For each full evil point cycle that the user spends
 in MajorMUD, this option controls the number of
 evil points that they will receive at the end of the
 day (cleanup).  Refer to the sysop release notes
 (wccmmud.rln) for more information BEFORE CHANGING.

EPAMOUNT {EPs to forgive per cycle? 1} N 1 100

 If you do not wish to take advantage of the features
 of the 'lawful' character style then set this
 option to NO.

ENABLAWF {Enable the choice of Lawful? YES} B

 This option sets the max coin type that will be swept up
 with the Coin Sweep option of the offline utilites.

COINSWP {Sweep coins of this and lower? GOLD} E USER_DEFINED PLATINUM GOLD SILVER COPPER NONE

 Set this option to yes if you want to sweep ganghouses
 with Coin Sweep

GCOINSW {Sweep coins from gang houses? NO} B
