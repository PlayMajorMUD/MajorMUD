1) Introduction

   MajorMUD is an interactive, text-based adventure game which
evolves around puzzle solving and character building.  The game
begins in the city of NewHaven where beginners can practice their
skills.  They then venture out to Silvermere and the world beyond.

   Users start by choosing one of several races, and
one of many classes.  Their character then becomes an adventurer
in the Realm, each with special skills and abilities.  Beginning
in the city of NewHaven with no money and limited weapons and 
equipment available, the user is free to try to advance his character
and make his fortune.
  
   Users advancement happens many ways.  A user can fight his way
through hordes of monsters, or traverse the realm looking for puzzles
to solve and wealth to find.

==========================================================================

2) Creating a Character

Before creating a character, you should determine which race and class
you wish to be.  Use the online help or this document to find out more
information about each race.  Once you have determined this, merely
enter the game from the main MajorMUD menu.  You will be given a list
of races after which you enter the number of the race you wish.  You
will then be given a list of classes after which you enter the number
of your chosen class.

You will then be put into a full-screen editor to enter the remaining
pieces of information about your character:
First Name  - You must enter a first name.  This name must be unique
              among all other MajorMUD players on your bbs, all 
              monsters in the game, and all game commands.  Make sure
              you like the name you choose, because

              YOU MAY NOT CHANGE YOUR FIRST NAME WITHOUT REROLLING.

Last Name   - There are currently no restrictions on your last name 
              except for the fact that it must be one word without
              punctuation.  Your sysop may request that you change
              this if they find it offensive.  By taking your character
              to an appropriate training hall, you may change your last
              name by typing TRAIN STATS (which will take you back to
              the full screen editor).

Stats       - You will be shown the base values for your stats and
              will be given a certain number of character points to
              assign to these stats as you choose.  Once you raise
              a stat and then save it (by exitting the full screen
              editor and choosing SAVE) then you MAY NOT LOWER IT AGAIN.
              You may, however, leave your Character Points waiting to
              be used until you know where you wish to place them.  Note
              that your character will be at a disadvantage if you have
              not used all of your character points.  See Appendix D -
              Game Stats for more help on each statistic.

Appearance  - You may use this screen to change your hair length, hair
              colour, or eye colour at any time (by typing TRAIN STATS
              in an appropriate training room for your class)

Once you save your character, the game will verify that your first name
is appropriately unique.  If it is not, you will be prompted to enter
a new name.  This will repeat until you enter an appropriate name.

You will then be shown your stat sheet and will start out in the town
of NewHaven where you start your adventure.

3) Commands

There are many commands available to you in MajorMUD.  Not all
commands are documented here.  The rest you will have to figure 
out as you play the game  (Some commands will be specific to
certain rooms).  If you cannot find the information you need in this 
document, please use the HELP command in the game to try and find
help on whatever you are looking for.

4) Customizing your Environment

There are a number of customizable features which each user may
change to their liking.  These settings will stay with you even 
if you reroll and start a new MajorMUD character.  At any point in
the game, you may type PROFILE to see your current profile settings.

The following are the available profile options:

Display Mode:
  This will control the amount of description you get everytime you
  enter a room.  There are two options:
    Brief   - Only display room header, items, people, monsters, exits
    Verbose - Display all of above, plus full text description of room 

StatusLine:
  This option controls the style of the statusline which you see
  as a prompt while playing MajorMUD.  There are three options:
    Off  - All you see as a statusline is ">"
    On   - You will see your hit points and mana or kai (if applicable)
    Full - As for 'on', but if you press ENTER, you will also receive
           a brief room description.

Broadcast Channel:
  This is the in-game broadcast channel which you are on.  Using the
  BROADCAST (BR for short) command, you can send messages to everyone
  who has the same channel as you.  If your bbs does not already have
  the ' key or the - key assigned to a global command, then you can
  precede a line with either of those characters to broadcast to this
  channel as well.  A broadcast channel can be in the range of 1 - 255.

Talking Speed:
  Your talking speed determines if you have to precede every line of
  text which you want to say with a character.  There are two options:
    Fast - You do NOT need to precede your line with a character.  Just
           type whatever you wish to say and it will be said to the room.
    Slow - You must precede all talking with a character (defaults to .)
           if you want to speak to the room.  If . does not work, it is
           because your sysop has changed it.  Type HELP TALKING to
           see the character which your sysop has chosen.

Follow Mode:
  When you are in a party, you will automatically follow the leader of
  your party.  When in this mode, often you do not wish to actually see
  any room descriptions as you move from room to room.  There are two
  options for this mode:
    Blind  - All you will see is the direction that you are moving
    Normal - You will see room descriptions as though you had moved yourself

Attack Interrupts:
  If you are calling the bbs using a slow modem (less than 14.4) then
  there are times when you may experience a backlog of text.  This means
  that the action in the game is going on, but you still haven't seen it
  happen yet because your modem is not fast enough to get it to you.  Some
  people have been known to take advantage of this by sending LOTS of data
  to you and then attacking you.  By the time you even see the first attack,
  there is a good chance that you will already be DEAD.  To get around this
  problem, you can turn attack interrupts on.  This will cancel all text
  going to you as soon as someone attacks you and send you a message 
  informing you of the attack.  Note that you may miss out on important
  messages this way, but at least you see the fact that someone is attacking 
  you.  There are two options for this setting:
    Enabled  - Your output will be interrupted to display the attack message
    Disabled - No attempt will be made to interrupt your output when attacked

Receive Items:
  Another technique which some users will do to attack you unfairly is to
  give you a lot of useless stuff and then attack you (often they will use
  a macro to do this as fast as possible).  The result of this is that they
  will greatly increase your encumbrance which will then slow you down if
  you try to run away or fight back.  You can use this option to stop
  people from giving you anything.  There are two options:
    Enabled  - You will accept anything you are given
    Disabled - You will not accept anything you are given

Warn on Evil:
  There are a number of actions in MajorMUD which will cause you to earn
  evil points.  As your number of evil points increases, the game will 
  start to punish you by sending guards, bounty hunters, or even lightning
  bolts after you.  If you wish to be stopped from even accidentally 
  performing an evil action, you may use this setting to stop you.
    On  - You will be warned before taking any evil action and stopped 
          from performing the action
    Off - You will not be warned and will earn evil points as usual.

Allow Telepaths:
  There are times in the game when you do not wish to be disturbed by
  anyone else in the game.  You can use this setting to stop people from
  telepathing to you.
    On  - Anyone can telepath messages to you
    Off - Nobody can telepath messages to you

Block Entrance Message:
  There are certain global messages which are sent to everyone who is
  playing the game.  These include (but are not limited to) messages
  indicating that a player has left or entered the realm.  If you do
  not wish to receive these, turn this option on.
    On  - You will not receive any global game messages
    Off - You will receive global game messages as normal

Keep Some Experience:
  When you die your last life, or reroll your character, you have the
  option of either starting fresh with 0 experience, or keeping some of
  the experience of your current character in your new character.
    On  - You will keep some experience in your next character
    Off - Your next character will start at 0 experience again.
  NOTE that your sysop may, at his/her discretion, disable this option
  on a system-wide basis.

Message Level:
  This option applies to those callers on lower speed lines as well as
  those who just don't want to be bothered with all the messages about
  things happening around them.  There are three settings for this option.
  You will have to experiment with them to find out which one is best for
  you.
    High   - You will see all messages about anything that happens around you
    Medium - You will not see as many messages as at high
    Low    - You will only see important messages that pertain to you

Paging:
  You may control two aspects of pages (or any bbs global messages) being
  sent to you.  First, you may turn them on or off:
    On  - People may page you or send you bbs global messages
    Off - People may not page you or send you bbs global messages.
  The second option is the frequency at which you can be paged (or 
  telepath'd).  You may specify the maximum number of these global messages
  which you wish to receive in a 3 second interval.

Talking Responses:
  When you are talking, there are two possible responses which the game
  can give to you.  They are as follows:
    Brief - The game will merely say 'Well spoken.'
    Verbose - The game will respond with 'You say, "whatever you said"'

Colour Palette:
  There are currently 4 different colour palettes in the game (0,1,2,3)
  which you may choose from.  The colour palette affects the colours which
  are used in numerous places in the game.  You will have to use trial and
  error to determine which palette is best for you, but in general palette
  0 is medium brightness, palette 1 is dim, palette 2 is the brightest, and
  palette 3 is a combination of 0 and 1.

Suicide Password:
  To help prevent accident suicide or reroll (as well as preventing your
  friends from doing it while your back is turned), there is a suicide
  password option which you may set.  Once set, you must enter it before
  you will be able to suicide or reroll.

Appendix A - Contacting the authors

If you wish to provide any feedback or problem reports, there
are several methods in which you can contact the authors of 
MajorMUD.  

If your board has Maillink (ask your local sysop), then you will 
be able to use the FEEDBACK command.  To use this command, merely
type FEEDBACK <followed with whatever you wish to say>.  An email
message will be generated and sent directly to the author of the 
game.

Again, if your board has Maillink, then your sysop will most
likely have setup a user discussion forum.  Although the game
designers only scan this forum briefly due to the volume of 
traffic, it is a good place to ask questions to see if anyone
else has figured out the answer already.
