HL1T4A {Class Powers} S 30 Help Topic String


HL1B4A {[0m[2J
 [1mHP/level: [0mThe number of Hit Points a class gains when going up a level, plus
           or minus the Health adjustment.

 [1mMagic: [0mThe type and level of magic use the character has. The type of magic
        'Mage, Druid, etc...' is self-explanatory. A magic level of 1
        indicates minor magical abilities 'ie. Priest-1'. A magic level of 2
        is average magical skill, and a magic level of 3 shows excellent
        magical powers. Kai powers are a Mystic's mental powers, and a Mystic
        will gain new ones as he gets more experienced.

 [1mCombat: [0mThis is a measure of the combat effectiveness of the class. A combat
         of 1 is Poor, 2 is Fair, 3 is Average, 4 is Good, and 5 is
         Excellent. This affects accuracy and speed of attacks.

 [1mWeapons: [0mThis shows what weapons a character may use. 1-handed means any
          one-handed weapon, Any means, of course, any weapon. Blunt means
          only blunt weapons may be used (mace, etc...) and Staff means only
          the staff and dagger may be used.

 [1mArmour: [0mLike weaponry, this indicates what armour a class may use. Scale
         means up to and including scale armour. Leather means up to and
         including Studded Leather. Any class may wear robes.

HL1T4B {Class Skills1 class skills 1 traps} S 41 Help Topic String


HL1B4B {[0m[2J
 [1mBash: [0mThis is the ability to deal a heavy, innacurate blow. See HELP COMBAT
       for details. Any class may Bash, but character classes with weak combat
       will rarely hit.

 [1mStealth: [0mThis is the skill of sneaking and concealment. A character with
          this skill can lurk in wait, concealed in the shadows of the room
          by typing HIDE. This can be used for a backstab. Also, you can
          sneak into a room by typing SNEAK and then moving. If you are lucky,
          no-one will see you, and then you can try to HIDE immediately or
          backstab some unfortunate person.

 [1mTraps: [0mAnyone with the Traps skill is proficient in finding and disarming
        traps. Normally anyone can find a trap by searching, but someone with
        the Traps skill has a much higher chance. Also, a traps expert can
        attempt to disarm any trap he finds.

 [1mLockpicking: [0mThis is the skill of unlocking locked doors. Some doors cannot
              be picked, and some are harder to pick than others. Once a door
              is successfully unlocked with this skill, it may be opened
              quite easily (unless there is a trap also!). Most locks are
              specially enchanted so that they will re-lock after a certain
              amount of time, so don't get yourself stuck anywhere.

HL1T4C {Class Skills2 Class Skills 2 thievery martial arts dodge} S 41 Help Topic String


HL1B4C {[0m[2J
 [1mThievery: [0mRobbing someone is a difficult skill, especially if the foe is not
           just another mark. Thievery is the ability to steal cash or items
           (non-equipped) from a character. A successful Thievery attempt will
           either gain you one item, or a substantial amount of cash from the
           target's money pouch.

 [1mTracking: [0mEveryone leaves a trail behind them while travelling around, even
           while sneaking. With this skill, it is possible to track someone
           wherever he goes. It is quite useful in setting up ambushes, to see
           if the target has passed nearby recently.

 [1mDodge: [0mThis is the ability a Mystic has to dodge attacks and missiles
        (including missile spells) by acrobatically leaping and rolling. This
        ability increases as the character get more experienced.

 [1mMartial Arts: [0mThis is the skill Mystics use in their unarmed combat. This
               ability allows you to attack with Punches, Kicks, and Jumpkicks
               as opposed to only Punches from an ordinary unarmed foe. The
               damage these attacks do increases with level, as does the
               chance of a critical hit.

[1;33m2. [0mPick a class that you feel comfortable with. We have tried to make ALL of
   the classes equal in efficiency, but each one has its own unique features.

[1;33m2. [0mOnce you have your character made, check out all of the stores in Newhaven
   and equip yourself with weaponry, armour, and spells (if you are a
   spellcaster). Don't go down into the arena until you are armed and ready.

[1;33m3. [0mTo familiarize yourself with the combat system, go to the Newhaven Arena.
   Here you will be able to earn experience for your next level, and gold to
   purchase better weaponry and armour. Once you have enough experience to
   obtain your next level, go to the guild and train.

[1;33m4. [0mNow that you have completed these steps, you could try adventuring in
   the dungeon past the north door in the Newhaven Arena. Type "bash north"
   or "picklock north" (If you have the skill) to open the lock/door.

[0;1;33mPrimary Statistics

[0mEvery character has six basic attributes, which govern the strengths and
weaknesses of each particular character. The six stats are Strength, Agility,
Health, Intellect, Willpower and Charm. Each race starts out with a [0;1mbase [0mvalue
and a [0;1mmaximum [0mvalue in each of the six stats. A character cannot have a stat
lower than the Base value, and cannot increase a stat beyond the Maximum value.
For example, Elves are slim but graceful, and for [0;1mAgility [0mhave a base value of
[0;31m50 [0mand a maximum value of [0;32m120[0m. In the [0;1;33mhelp [0mfiles, the base value in each stat
is coloured [0;31mred[0m, and the maximum is coloured [0;32mgreen[0m. [0;1mHumans [0mform the "benchmark"
for all other races, and have a base value of [0;31m40 [0mand a maximum value of [0;32m100 [0min
every stat. A value of [0;1m50 [0mindicates an average value, giving no bonuses or
penalties, while values above and below 50 give penalties or bonuses as
applicable.

Stats can be changed by spending [0;1mCP [0m(character points) in character creation or
after Training. Since every character receives CP after increasing in level, it
is generally a wise idea to use these gained CP in a [0;1mTraining Hall[0m, by typing
'[0;1;33mTRAIN STATS[0m'. This will place you in the character editor (ANSI
recommended).

Type '[0;1;33mHELP STATS2[0m' for more information on allocating your stats and how to
use the character editor. There is also a seperate help topic for each stat,
which will give information on what the stat does and what parts of the
character it affects. For example, you would type '[0;1;33mHELP STRENGTH[0m' to get info
on Strength.

The first 1 to 10 points above your race's base stat:  1 CP each.
The second 1 to 10 points above your race's base stat: 2 CP each.
The third 1 to 10 points above your race's base stat:  3 CP each.

... and so on. This means that to increase a stat [0;1m40 [0mpoints above its base
level, say, [0;1mAgility 40 [0mto [0;1mAgility 80 [0m(a BIG leap!), you would have to spend
10 CP's for the first 10 Agil, 20 CP's for the second 10 Agil, 30 CP's for the
third 10 Agil, and 40 CP's for the fourth set of 10 Agility. This adds up to
a grand total of 10 CP + 20 CP + 30 CP + 40 CP = [0;1m100 CP[0m! Very expensive, as
you can see, and not very wise: even though your character would be incredibly
agile, he would be weak, fragile, stupid, etc... and that makes a big
difference. Having a one-dimensional character may be fun for a while, but
your character probably would not last very long. In the end a more balanced
character would be more enjoyable and would survive longer.

Note that 'high' or 'low' stats are stats above or below 50, respectively.
Each stat has a different use. Type [0;1;33mHELP STATNAME [0mfor details on a particular
stat and its effects on your character and his abilities.

[1;33mSTRENGTH (STR)

[0mStrength is a measure not just of your raw muscle mass, but also how well you
can use that strength. Good Strength adds to how easily you attack something in 
combat, as well as the damage you do when you hit. Some weapons need a high 
Strength to use effectively. Conversely, low strength reduces how well you hit
something, and the damage you do. A Halfling warrior may be extremely quick, 
but he will do fairly poor damage when compared to a Dwarf! Strength also 
governs how much weight you can carry without being encumbered. Strength
is a necessary stat for any fighting class, but is useful for magic-using
classes as well, because no-one has an unlimited supply of magic! It is used
when bashing down doors and in some instances for moving heavy objects.

[1;33mAGILITY (AGI)

[0mAgility is basically how quick and accurate you are in your movements. It
involves not only speed, but total body coordination as well. A character with
high Agility attacks faster and more accurately, and a high Agility helps
defend against physical attacks. Low Agility, of course, makes you slower and
less accurate. An Elf will hit far more often than a Half-Ogre, though a
Half-Ogre's incredible crushing blows may compensate. Agility is a component
of most skills, and is extremely useful for a thief. A thief with high agility
will have very good skills! Again, Agility is a necessary stat for any
fighting class.

Agility is important for the following character skills: [1mStealth[0m, [1mThievery[0m,
[1mTraps [0mand [1mPicklocks[0m. It contributes heavily to your [1mAccuracy [0mand [1mCritical Hit

HL1B18D {[0m
[1;33mINTELLECT (INT)

[0mIntellect is a combination of raw intelligence, creativity, reasoning and
basic awareness. Intellect is useful for all classes in respect to their
Perception, which is a skill that helps notice hidden and concealed items
(and people!). A character with a low Intellect may not notice things very
often, such as people sneaking around, robbing them, etc. Intellect is a main
component in many skills, and is useful to a thief, but it is vital to a mage!
Mages use Intellect as the main stat for their spells. A Mage with low
Intellect will be at a severe disadvantage with spells when compared to a mage
with higher Intellect. Druids use both Intellect and Wisdom for their spells,
so they need to have good levels in both stats. Warrior-types can usually get
along without much Intellect, and historically many have done so -- but
Intellect is also a component of Critical Hits, so a canny fighter will do
heavy blows more often than a dull-witted opponent.

Intellect directly affects the following skills and abilities: [1mStealth[0m,
[1mThievery[0m, [1mTraps[0m, [1mPicklocks[0m, [1mTracking[0m, [1mPerception[0m, [1mMagic Resistance[0m,

[0mThis stat is a measure of the character's cool-headedness, determination,
mental focus and strength of faith. It is a must for any Priestly character,
as this is the stat they use for their spell-casting. Druids use both
Willpower and Intellect, so they need to have good levels in both stats.
Willpower is the prime component in Magic Resistance, so anyone needing to
resist spells had better have a good value in this stat. A Witchunter with
high WIL would have a formidable MagicRes! As for Intellect, a Warrior-type
could probably get along with a low Wisdom, but would then be much more
vulnerable to magic spells.

Willpower directly affects the following skills and abilities: [1mSpellcasting[0m,

HL1B18F {[0m
[0;1;33mHEALTH (HEA)

[0mHealth is a character's vitality, toughness, and general physical well-being.
Health governs how many Hit Points a character starts with, as well as how
many are gained each time a new Level is reached. Poison is less effective on
a healthier person, and Health is a component in Magic Resistance. Where
Willpower is the toughness of the mind, Health is the toughness of the body.
Health is a prime stat for any fighting classes, but is very useful for all
characters, as everyone will sustain damage at some point in their perilous
careers.

Having a high Health increases the rate at which you naturally heal, and the
rate at which you gain HP through resting. It may also confer an increased
resistance to some poisons and diseases. Characters with above- or below-
average Health will notice a change in their Hit Points, which will vary
depending on your Level and your Health. Health no longer has "stat breaks"
where you must have a certain level of Health to obtain the increases (in the
past, you needed to have 65, 80 or 95 Health for the bonuses), and now works as
a gradual process that increases your HP as both your Health and Level increase.
Therefore, it is possible that even a one-point increase in Health could 
increase your total HP.

[1;33mCHARM (CHA)

[0mCharm is a hard stat to pin down -- it is not an actual measure of a person's
good looks, but people with high charm are quite attractive to others. It
helps with interpersonal relations, such as buying items from store-owners,
as a charming person can lower the price of an item substantially. Charm helps
in combat, because people are more likely to attack an offensive person than
someone with a disarming smile. Charm is a component in some skills, as Charm
is not only a measure of a character's charm, but a person with good Charm
leads a Charmed life, so to speak, and in general is much luckier than other
characters. Such a one would find himself miraculously dodging out of the way
of some attacks, where others would have been hit. Charm is the main stat for
use in Bard spells, and a Bard with low Charm will be a very poor Bard indeed.
All characters can use a good dose of Charm.

[0;1;33mWEAPONS AND ARMOUR

[0mThe realm is a dangerous place, and no character will survive long without
protection. Most character will need a good weapon-- usually the more 
expensive, the better, but try out many different ones until you find one that
seems right for you. One factor you must keep in mind is that all weapons have
a minimum strength, and anyone with a lower strength will suffer from slower
attacks. When you ready the weapon, if it says "This weapon feels heavy in your
hands.", then you need more strength to wield it effectively.

Armour is important for everyone. The best armours are the heavier ones, but
often force your [0;1mencumbrance[0m up to uncomfortable levels. You should never 
neglect to wear armour, and make sure you are wearing a piece of armour on
every location you can! Your AC/DR stat is a measure of how protected you are:
AC stands for Armour Class, and DR stands for Damage Reduction. AC makes you 
harder to hit, as your armour deflects blows. DR absorbs the damage of
the attack when you do get hit. If you have high DR, the attack may do no damage at
all! Note that your AC and DR do not affect the damage you take from spells-- 
increase your [0;1mMagic Resistance[0m for that!

[0;1;33mSTEALTH

[0mThe art of stealth manifests itself in many forms, providing additional

hide commands, a character is able to move unseen throughout the realm. A
sneaking character will not be seen when entering a room (provided he makes his
stealth check), but may be seen by anyone actively looking around. It is harder
to sneak into a well-lit or heavily populated room. A hiding character lurks in
the shadows, and cannot be seen at all provided a stealth check is passed. Only
when someone uses the [0;1msearch[0m command will the hider be found. Neither sneak nor
hide may be used while in combat. These two commands provide effective ways to
avoid combat, but when used in conjunction with the [0;1mbackstab[0m command, allow
the stealthy character to attempt devastating surprise attacks. Backstabs may
be attempted after a successful sneak roll, or while hidden, and if successful
will do massive damage to the target. Not all weapons may be used to backstab

HL1T82 {Magic Resistance Magicres} S 30 Help Topic String


HL1B82 {
[0;1;33mMAGIC RESISTANCE (MagicRes)

[0mEvery character has a certain level of Magic Resistance. It affects your
chance of resisting offensive spells, and reduces the damage you take from
combat spells significantly. Having a low value in this stat will result in
you getting whomped by spellcasters! Witchunters will find that they resist
beneficial magic as well as the offensive kind, as they never willingly
submit to the effects of magic. Having a high Willpower will greatly increase
this stat, while Intellect will also increase it a little. Though many 
Warrior-types neglect to increase these stats, they often regret it later.

[0;1;33mCHARACTER POINTS (CP)

[0mEach race starts with a certain amount of CPs (character points) which may
be assigned to your stats.  Use these wisely because they will define the
way your character performs in the game.

When you train, you will receive additional CPs to assign to your stats. To do
so, type TRAIN STATS in your training hall. Also see [0;1mStats1[0m and [0;1mStats2[0m in the
help files for more information on training.

Note that you do not have to assign all of your CPs to create a character.
If you wish, you may wait until you have entered the game and talked to 
other people before typing TRAIN STATS in your training hall to allocate
your CPs.

HL1B104 {
[0;1;33mSPELLCASTING (SC)

[0m"The" stat to have for all spellcasters, Spellcasting is a measure of your
knowledge and skill in casting spells. It is affected by the Magery level of
your class-- Mages will have a better Spellcasting than Warlocks. For Mage-
types, Intellect is the main stat that increases SC, while Willpower helps
somewhat. For Priest-types, Willpower is the main stat, with Intellect helping
a bit. Druid-types use both Intellect and Willpower equally, while Bards use
only Charm for their spellcasting. Mystics do not use any stat at all-- their

You will be prompted to select a new race, and when you have done so, you will
be back at the main menu. Then enter MajorMUD once more to complete the change
and to change your stats.

The time you have to change your race wil be displayed on the main menu beside
the ChangeRace menu command. The amount shown is the time your have, in
[1mGAME MINUTES[0m, before you no longer have the option of changing your race. You
may change race any number of times during that period. Note that the time you
are allowed does not tick down while you are not in the game-- it only gets
used up while you are in MajorMUD playing, not while you are at the main menu
or while logged off. A good use of this time is to try out a new race, test it
to see if you like it, if its EXP chart is too high for you, and if it just
"feels right". If you don't like it then you can simply change. But keep an eye
on the time!

Also note that the race have been carefully balanced in terms of power and EXP
cost. Some races are more suited for certain roles than others, but ALL of them
are good. Don't overlook a Human Mage just because he doesn't have any natural
abilities-- he will be a few levels higher than everyone else!
